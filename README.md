### What you are supposed to understand
Make sure you have completed phase 1 and phase 2

- [ ] Variables and data types 
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Arrays and array methods
- [ ] Conditions and If statements 
- [ ] Loops and different ways of looping in Javascript

> Files to use are included in this repo and are indicated below in italics

- [ ] Write a JavaScript program that accept two integers and display the larger. 

- [ ] Write a JavaScript for loop that will iterate from 0 to 15. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is odd or even, and display a message to the console. Go to the editor.  
       Sample Output :   
         "0 is even"   
         "1 is odd"   
         "2 is even"  

    
- [ ] Write a JavaScript program to sum the multiples of 3 and 5 under 1000
- [ ] Write a function named assignGrade that:
       - takes 1 argument, a number score.
       - returns a grade for the score, either "A", "B", "C", "D", or "F".
       - Call that function for a few different scores and log the result to make sure it works.
- [ ] Check the results of your **assignGrade** ‚òùüèæ function from the above exercise by logging every value from 60 to 100: your log should show "For 88, you got a B. For 89, you got a B. For 90, you got an A. For 91, you got an A.", etc., logging each grade point in the range.

**Note**: Use the provided files to show your solutions, using the knowledge you learned in the Github course, you can close and commit and push back to your fork in BongoHive organization.
